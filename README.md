# How to Run the Project

This project consists of a Vite React frontend and a Node.js backend.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14.x or later)
- npm

## Running the Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   The backend should now be running on http://localhost:8080 (or your configured port).

## Running the Frontend

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the Vite dev server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open your browser and visit the URL shown in the terminal (typically http://localhost:5173).

Both servers need to be running simultaneously for the full application to work.
